A pattern is a solution to a problem in a context. The **context** is the situation in which
the pattern applies; This should be a recurring situation.

The **problem** refers to the gloal your're  trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers
to any constraints that occur int the conxt;

The **solution** is what you're after: a general design that anynone can apply which reolves the goal and set of constraints.

There are 3 categories of design pattern:


# Creational patterns

creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of
related objects

# Structural patterns

structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other

# Behavior patterns

behavioral pattern is concerned with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility.
